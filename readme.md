# Talk to Women Who Code (KL) and Ethereum Malaysia (KL)

## Smart Contracts & Blockchain use cases
## 29th November 2018

This talk explains the basics of blockchain based smart contracts and what they add to the software tool kit.

It can be seen at https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/DaveAppleton/WWC_ETHKL/talk.slide but you should note that the example on slide 11 will not run because it requires my user machine.

Enjoy.
